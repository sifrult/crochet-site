                    <p>I learned to crochet from my grandmother when I was young, but I thought it was only something old people did.. (Sorry grandma!) It wasn't until I went to college when I found crochet again and made hats, gloves, and scarves for winter. Soon after, I realized there's way more I could do with crochet!
                    <br><br>I began making amigurumi, which are just small stuffed toys. Since I discovered there's more to crochet than just scarves and gloves, I haven't stopped crocheting! It's one of my favorite hobbies.
                    <br><br>Even now, I don't crochet just for myself anymore. I have two young girls who love getting new toys! I have crocheted quite a few stuffed animals for them, that I hope they will keep for years to come.</p>
